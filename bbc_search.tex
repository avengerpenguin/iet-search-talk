  Some parts of the BBC website have a specialised, ``scoped'' search
  that only searches amongst content for that part of the site. Here,
  we see the result of having clicked the ``iPlayer'' navigation link
  and then used the search box.

  This is based on the assumption that if someone is already on the
  iplayer pages, then any searches they do will be for only TV and
  Radio programmes that are currently available to watch or listen to.

  convenience of only showing pages for the section we're in, but also
  providing a safe, appropriate subsection of the wider BBC website
  for children where they are only navigating, searching and viewing
  things that are known to be suitable.

  provider of the core search engine itself and then do some improvements
  that won't be too visible to the audience right away. Hopefully once
  we've cut out old parts that are no longer in use and generally improve
  the architecture, it will make it easier to try a lot more visible

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is the web?}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \pause \item Collection of pages/documents
    \pause \item Each has a unique address, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_Wide\_Web
    \pause \item Those addresses are known as \emph{Uniform Resource Locators} (URLs)
    \pause \item Pages/documents contain \emph{hyperlinks} to other pages/documents
    \pause \item We now have images, videos, games, etc. and not just pages and documents
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\note{
  Firstly, it might be useful to outline a precise and distilled
  definition of what the World Wide Web (or WWW or just ``web'')
  actually is.

  The Web is essentially the collection of all pages we can get to
  with a web browser, each with a unique address, known as a
  Uniform Resource Locator or URL. Where the web metaphor
  comes in is that these pages can link to each other by embedding
  each other's URLs and thus pages can reference each other easily.

  Of course, it's not just pages that make up this web, but images
  videos, games, machine-readable information, etc. For a web
  search intended for use by people -- as it the case with Google
  primarily or the BBC Search -- we can focus for now on pages
  (and to some extent videos, games, etc. as people are interested
  in watching and playing those, but they bring their own challenges).

    \pause \item Crawl the web to find new pages
    \pause \item Index pages to make it easier to search
    \pause \item Searching/querying the page index
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\note {
  The process involved in putting together any search engine such
  as Google can essentially be broken down into three phases:
  1) web crawling or otherwise acquiring a list of pages/items that you
  want the search to be able to find; 2) organising those pages/items
  into an index that is easily and quickly searchable; and 3) performing
  searches or queries against that index to present a list of
  pages that are likely of interest to the person who entered a search.

  We can aliken this to creating even a paper index of books within
  a library without even involving a computer-based system. First,
  we must acquire a list of books the library has, which we can do
  by walking along all the shelves and taking note of what we have.
  Then we must take this list of books and organise them in some way.
  For example, we could reorder them into a system such as Dewey Decimal
  where they are grouped by genre or category. We could keep a list
  of which floor of our library has which categories and which books
  we have in each category. We could even
  write some extra keywords on our list next to each book so make it
  easier to see at a glance precisely what each book is about.
  Then, finally we have a visitor who enters the library, tells us
  they are looking for books on, say, psychology and we can refer
  to our list, perhaps ask them to be more specific about their
  query (child psychology, perhaps) and then we can point them
  to a recommended floor, shelf number and possibly a list of book
  titles they might be interested in.
}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Web Crawlers}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Visit a page already known about
    \item Add that page to the search index
    \item Find all the links in that page
    \item Store all those links and visit them as well
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\note {
  A web search such as Google can only know about pages people
  might be looking for by crawling as many pages on the web that
  can be found. This is the equivalent of taking stock and writing
  down all the books on the library shelf, except in this case
  we have a whole web of pages and content that is effectively boundless --
  a stark contrast to a library of very finite size.

  We can start a crawling process by visiting a page we know about -- let's
  say the front page of Wikipedia. We can note the content of that page
  and index it, but the page itself will contain links to many featured articles.
  We can keep a note of all those links, follow them to the articles themselves
  and repeat the crawl process using all the links on those pages.
}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Extracting Content}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{wikipedia.png}
\end{frame}
\note{
  So, we have a list of pages, like the Wikipedia article shown. Before we
  can create our index, there is at least one important challenge to overcome
  first. Looking at the Wikipedia article shown, there's text that doesn't
  actually form part of the article such as the navigation menu down the side.

  We don't want to suggest this article when someone searches for ``current events''
  or ``random article'', so we need to find a way to identify what is part
  of the actual article and what is not. It's probably clear to us as humans, but
  how do we make a machine understand that distinction? It's less obvious to a
  computer and different websites have different layouts, so this can be quite
  an interesting challenge.

    \end{tabular}

  \end{center}
\end{frame}
\note{
  After having crawled or otherwise collected up a collection of documents or
  pages that we might want to present in search results, we need to create
  a search index that will enable accurate and quick queries to be made against
  it. Clearly, reading through every article for keywords entered by a user
  every time a new query in is an inefficient way to work. The process of indexing
  arranges all your documents and pages in such a way as to make searches easier,
  much like the Dewey Decimal categorisation in our library example earlier.

  A very basic form of search index is the \emph{inverted index}. Here, we create
  a lookup table where each word points to the documents that contain that word.
  In the example shown, if a user types in the word ``pigs'', we can point them
  at the second and third document. Note how we can do that with one lookup and
  we are not required to read through each document looking for the word ``pigs'',
  which would be much more time consuming on large documents.

  There are many more sophisticated structures and arrangements that can
  bring other benefits, but this is already a much faster way to find documents
  that match a keyword. However, if we were to add a document that contains
  the word ``mouse'', should that be put in the same row along with the first
  document that contains mouse? This leads us onto the linguistic techniques we
  need to consider when building a search index.

      \pause \item Think, Thought
      \pause \item Good, Better, Best
    \end{itemize}
    \pause \item All of this only applies to \emph{English}
    \pause \item Other languages need their own rules
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note {
  In the previous slide, we assumed we had already extracted all the words out
  of a document, but even that process might not be as simple as it would seem.
  The process for turning paragraphs of text into individual words or \emph{tokens}
  as the more exact term should be is known as \emph{tokenisation}.

  For English, we can assume a space breaks text into words, but not all languages
  behave this way. Chinese has no boundaries between words. Even in English, we
  sometimes have things like apostrophes or hyphens. Perhaps we might want to
  identify very specific tokens such as smiley faces or maybe we want to treat
  names like \emph{Robin Hood} as a single token since the individual words
  \emph{robin} and \emph{hood} carry very different meanings when encountered
  individually.

  Once we have our words, we probably don't want swim and swimming to be seen
  differently as they are essentially the same word. This is know as \emph{stemming}.
  Stemming gets more complex that just removing letters when you have things like
  \emph{dry} and \emph{dries} where you have to change letters as well as remove
  to get the common stem. Then the problem of \emph{overstemming} can occur when
  removing what looks like simple suffices actually changes the word. Here, we can
  see that \emph{musical} is fine to lose the suffix \emph{-al} where
  it's the adjective from the noun \emph{music}, but it might be incorrect when a document
  is taking about the noun \emph{musical} as in a stage production since those two
  concepts aren't exactly the same thing. It gets worse still if our stemming
  process also decided to reduce \emph{musician} down to the same as music as that
  is, again, a different concept.

  Lemmatisation overlaps somewhat with stemming in that stemming could be seen
  as a na\"ive approach to lemmatisation. Our goal here is not just to reduce
  a word to some root stem before using it for our index, but also to find
  all inflections or variants and reduce them to their \emph{lemma}. So \emph{swimming}
  was previously stemmed to swim, but we also want to recognise that \emph{swam}
  and \emph{swum} could probably be converted to \emph{swim} as well before indexing.
  We have other examples such as think, thought, catch, caught. It's not just verbs
  either as \emph{better} and \emph{best} could be recognised as variants of
  \emph{good}.

  The main difference between stemming and lemmatisation is that stemming happens
  without any real context of the word and can make more mistakes, but is a lot faster.
  Lemmatisation usually takes into account the meaning of the word in the sentence
  and is less likely to confuse things like \emph{musical} the adjective and
  \emph{musical} the noun for a stage production.

  All of this is fairly technical linguistics terminology, but the easiest way to think of
  it all is that the lemma of a word is the form you would look up in a dictionary. So,
  if you wanted to know the meaning of the word ``caught'' you are likely to look
  up ``catch'' and wouldn't really expect there to be an entry for caught.

  The result of this if we look back at our inverted index example before:

      \hline
      \bf{Words}     & \bf{Documents}              \\ \hline
      three    & Document 1,Document 2\\ \hline
      \bf{pig}     & Document 2,Document 3 \\ \hline
      blind    & Document 1             \\ \hline
      \bf{mouse}     & Document 1             \\ \hline
      little   & Document 2             \\ \hline
      in       & Document 3             \\ \hline
      \bf{blanket} & Document 3             \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

  \end{center}
\end{frame}
\note{
  We see that our index now prefers the singular forms pig, mouse and blanket. So,
  if we were then to add a document with the word ``mouse'' it would be put in the same
  entry as ``three blind mice'' and a someone querying our search index could
  type ``mouse'' or ``mice'' and it would find either entry. This is clearly
  better for users and you can try this out on Google by searching ``mice'' yourself and
  you will likely get plenty of results with ``mouse'' in the title.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Searching the index}
  \begin{itemize}
    \pause \item User enters some keywords
    \pause \item Look up documents/pages that contain keywords
    \pause \item Present a list of results
    \pause \item Should results contain all or just some of the keywords?
    \pause \item What order should results be in?
    \pause \item What other information can be used?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
  The third and final stage in our search system is the actual searching
  of the index itself. We've already covered this a bit since our
  inverted index made this quite easy with one lookup.

  We start by taking the keywords the user typed in and search our index
  for all documents containing those words and then present a list of
  those documents as candidates for what the user was probably seeking.

  There are many more intricate techniques to do with what to do
  if the document only contains some of the words, how best to order
  the results and Google itself takes into account a lot of contextual
  information such as time and where in the world you are.

  We can look briefly at how we decide which are the better matches so
  we can order the results and also how Google deals with the issue
  of wanting to prefer trustworthy sources for a topic.

  So, we've found a list of documents or pages that seem to match
  a search query, but how can we determine which of them is
  the ``best'' match? Searches like Google tend to show results
  as a list from most relevant or best match down to the lesser matches
  towards the end of the list.

  There are many ways to do this, we can look at an example of one
  approach known as \emph{tf-idf}.

  \frametitle{Google Pagerank}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pagerank.png}\\
  \tiny
  An art draw drawn by Felipe Micaroni Lalli (micaroni@gmail.com).
\end{frame}
\note {
  In the tf-idf scoring algorithm before, we saw that pages and documents
  score highly if they contain many references to a search term, especially
  if that term rarely appears in other documents. The assumption with
  this is that all pages are equal however. This means I can put up
  any old page I like about a topic such as web search and -- if
  I meantion the words web and search enough -- I can appear above
  the Wikipedia article, say, on that topic.

  One disadvantage of
  the World Wide Web is the ease of creating pages allows for a sea
  of non-trustworthy, inaccurate, malicious and unhelpful sites that
  can make finding a reliable and suitable site a difficult endeavour.

  To counter this, Larry Page developed Pagerank at Stanford University
  back in 1996 and this forms a large part of the commercial search
  offered by Google today, although it is likely supported by
  many alterations and additiona algorithms now.

  Briefly, this is best illustrated by the artistic graphic shown here.
  The largest face has the highest Pagerank because it is linked to by
  the most other faces. This is similar to how a lot of people are likely
  to link to well-known and reliable sources such as Wikipedia for general
  topics or BBC News when referring to a current event.

  The smaller faces represent lesser-known sites. They link to other pages,
  but nobody is linking to them, so Google won't give high scores to search
  results unless they are such brilliant matches for a search term that
  they outweigh the larger, well-known sites.

  Note that the red one at the top has only one link to it, yet it is
  larger than the green one nearest it. This is because the link to
  it comes from a very well-respected website and it gives more weight
  to that single link. All Pageranks are calculated in this way in
  that a site with a larger Pagerank feeds more into the Pagerank of
  all other sites it links to. In this way, sites with a lot of respect
  can figuratively ``vouch for'' other sites simply by linking to them.

  Thus the final ``score'' of a potential result for a search query is
  some combination of the keywords in the document and the Pagerank
  notability score.

  \frametitle{Search Design Patterns}
  % TODO: Image
  \missingfigure
\end{frame}
\note{
  So, we've looked at the technical and mathematical side of finding
  content, indexing it for fast retrieval and then performing queries
  against that content index. However a large part of a search application
  is the human interaction with it. Google was notable in the late 1990s
  for its simplistic, no-nonsense interface at a time when other large
  content providers were producing home pages with multiple links
  and other distractions.

  As the web, searching and web design in general has matured over the years,
  common solutions or \emph{patterns} has emerged that we can explore
  briefly now.
}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Standard Search Interface}
  % TODO: Image
  \missingfigure  
\end{frame}
\note{
  We can see here the standard search interface common to mosh search
  systems. There's the search box into which users can type their queries,
  a button such as a magnifying glass for submitting that query and results
  are displayed in a list down the page from ``best'' down to ``worst''
  match.

  So, a common problem with relying on people to type in queries by hand
  is that users don't always write queries that will get the results they
  like. They aren't always aware when they use ambiguous terms, when
  they make spelling mistakes or when they don't give specific enough
  information.

  We can solve some of this in the searching and querying algorithms we
  looked at before. For example, we can make assumptions about what the
  user meant to type if they make a spelling mistake and fix their
  query for them. However, there is only so much you can do before you
  are second guessing the user's intentions and risk the system behaving
  unexpectedly by returning results for a query very different from what
  was actually typed in.

  Since we are looking at design patters, is there a way to solve this
  at the human interface level?

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Autocomplete}
  %TODO
  \missingfigure
\end{frame}
\note{
  A common feature of search systems is an autocomplete. This is commonly
  implemented as some prompt underneath where you are typing. The prompt
  can suggest words or concepts you might be typing and speed up query
  entry. The side effect of this is that users are more likely to type
  in correctly-spelled words if they choose suggestions more often than
  type them in by hand.
}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Autosuggest}
  %TODO
  \missingfigure
\end{frame}
\note {
  Autosuggest is a feature similar to, but subtly distinct from autocomplete.
  The mechanism is similar in that a prompt can suggest searches as the user
  is typing their query, but rather than offering potential completions
  of words or phrases in their query alone, more sophisticated and complex
  suggestions can be made.

  For example, we might see that a user is typing in ``what's on TV'' and
  suggest a link to ``TV Schedules''. This is not a completion of what
  the user was typing, but likely a valid suggestion. A user might type
  the number 1 and we might suggest ``BBC One'' or ``BBC Radio One''.
  They might be typing in a football team like ``Manchester U''. We can
  simultaneously offer the completion ``Manchester United'' whilst also
  suggest things like ``Premier League tables''.
}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Spell Check}
  %TODO
  \missingfigure
\end{frame}
\note {
  Another common and recognisable feature for helping users form correct
  queries is one which offers correct spellings of words in their queries.
  More precisely, searches such as Google can offer things like
  ``Did you mean?'' where they can identify that for the sake of changing
  one or two letters, the query would have returned a lot more and better
  results. This does not require a dictionary as such to look up spelling
  mistakes, but more relies on the indexes themselves to be a good
  authority on what are real words or not.

  Google is in a particularly strong position to do such what is essentially
  a statistical approach to correcting search queries. Their indexes are
  perhaps a better record of English (or any language) in its common use
  than any dictionary compiled by hand. They can use this large body
  of real language usage to do their automatic translation service. Instead
  of hiring linguists and translators for every language, they can
  infer a lot based on observations such as whenever an English site
  uses the word ``apple'' a French site tends to use the word ``pomme''.
  Even better is that this gives a contextual sensitivity that a simple
  dictionary could never do. For example, a large collection of French
  and English documents could tell use that ``apple juice'' tends to be
  ``jus de pomme'' in French, but that ``Apple Computers'' tends to be
  exactly the same in French.

  \frametitle{Facets}

\note{
  Sometimes the results we get back might be quite generic across multiple
  kinds of content. I might enter a generic query such as ``football'' and
  get a mix of football news stories, football results tables, TV programmes
  that feature football and maybe even films that are about football such
  as ``Bend It Like Beckham''.

  A common interface feature here is to provide facets, which are indication
  of the categories your results fall into and allow you to narrow down your
  search to things only within a particular category.

\note{
  In all of the search techniques shown so far, what should happen if I search
  ``plumber'' in Google? Clearly any page on the World Wide Web that mentions
  plumber or plumbing is relevant to my search. We can use Google's Pagerank
  to prefer trustworthy sites that receive many links over unknown sites, but
  the obvious problem remains: what use is a very trustworthy plumber in
  Adelaide if I live in Stockport?

  Google already takes your current country into account by virtue of whether
  you are using google.co.uk or google.fr or google.de. This means if we're
  searching for things where the country really matters -- such as local
  businesses -- we can prefer results within the same country. With
  smartphones and other ways of detecting a user's exact location down to city
  or post code level, we can be even smarter and show only plumbers in
  Greater Manchester, say.

  Where can the BBC make use of this? Well, the BBC allows you to search for
  your location already for localising the home page, presenting local
  news or giving you the weather near you. This is something we don't
  currently make much use of, but if a user searches ``local news''
  and we know they live in Cardiff, perhaps we can bias towards news
  local to South Wales?

\note{
  This is a common search feature that might be questionable to the
  average user. Sometimes we want to perform a very exact query for
  a particular search term but with very precise restrictions over
  how recent item is or other aspects such as categories for the items.

  Whilst this can be achieved with facets as shown earlier, a common
  pattern is to allow the user to open up an advanced search form before
  searching anything in order to specify very precise search restrictions.

  The reason why I personally flag it as questionable is that the same
  effect can be achieved by allowing a very basic search in the first
  instance, but then present ways to narrow that down later. A simple
  interface is normally better for most people and Google does not
  even offer ``advanced search'' as a feature. Despite that,
  many other websites offer an ``advanced search'' link that offers
  up a more powerful form for very precise queries.

\note{
  The last pattern I'll cover here is the idea of presenting users
  with ``more like this''. This is most notably used by Amazon for directing
  users to products that they might be interested in, not because they
  searched specifically for terms that match those products, but because
  products that \emph{did} match their search are similar to other ones
  they might wish to buy.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item We can search the BBC via Google
    \item What can the BBC offer that Google cannot?
    \item Knowledge Graph
    \item BBC Domain Knowledge
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
  So, Google has the ability to search every website on the World Wide Web.
  So, why should a website provide its own search feature? Why, specifically,
  should the BBC provide a search feature?

  Normally, I believe a lot of websites with a lot of text content are
  ill-advised to attempt to build their own search. If they build the site
  in such a way as to be found optimally by the Google crawler, they will
  appear in global searches and Google can also be used to provide
  a local, ``site'' search as well.

  However, Google's text-based indexing and matching doesn't fully
  understand concepts such as BBC programmes, for example. A search on
  Google for ``Question Time'' might just match pages that mention the
  words ``question'' and ``time'' but Google doesn't have the insight
  to know that ``Question Time'' is the exact title of programme produce
  by the BBC.

  Firstly, this is now somewhat misleading in that Google has recently
  released a feature known as ``Knowledge Graph'' in which it attempts to
  understand concepts and present snippets on the side. Secondly, this
  feature still doesn't understand that ``Question Time'' is a concept.

\end{frame}
\note{
  Now, Google results are pretty good when searching for Question Time
  because it's finding pages where those words appear together and
  promoting those to the top of results, but it still lacks some key insight
  the fact that this is a programme and other information about that, such
  as when it is next on or how long it will be available to watch on
  iPlayer.
